    Many people have oily skin during puberty, but some people’s skin is oily all their life,
     because of predisposing genes or hormones. If your parents had oily skin, you may have it, too.
      And any hormonal changes – due to menstruation, pregnancy, emotional situations, 
    the transition into menopause – can also cause skin to become oily.

// A milk bath may help treat psoriasis symptoms, including
//  itchy, flaky, or patchy skin. However, scientific research 
//  is limited on the effectiveness of a milk bath to treat psoriasis.
